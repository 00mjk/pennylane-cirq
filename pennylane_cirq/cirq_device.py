Base Framework device class
===========================

**Module name:** :mod:`plugin_name.device`

.. currentmodule:: plugin_name.device

An abstract base class for constructing Target Framework devices for PennyLane.

This should contain all the boilerplate for supporting PennyLane
from the Target Framework, making it easier to create new devices.
The abstract base class below should contain all common code required
by the Target Framework.

This abstract base class will not be used by the user. Add/delete
methods and attributes below where needed.

See https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/API/overview.html
for an overview of how the Device class works.
