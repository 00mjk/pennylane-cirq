**Module name:** :mod:`pennylane_cirq.simulator_device`

.. currentmodule:: pennylane_cirq.simulator_device

This Device implements all the :class:`~pennylane.device.Device` methods,
for using Target Framework device/simulator as a PennyLane device.

It can inherit from the abstract FrameworkDevice to reduce
code duplication if needed.


See https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/API/overview.html
for an overview of Device methods available.

        shots (int): Number of circuit evaluations/random samples used
