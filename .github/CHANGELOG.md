# Release 0.8.0

### Improvements

* Ported the `CirqDevice` class to use the new `QubitDevice` base class,
  enabling the use of tensor observables.
  [#19](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-cirq/pull/19)

* Added support for inverse operations by defining the `.inv()` method
  of the `CirqOperation` class which uses the `cirq.inverse` function.
  [#15](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-cirq/pull/15)

### Bug fixes

* Fix a minor bug introduced into the test suite by the release of Cirq 0.7.0.
  [#18](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-cirq/pull/18)

* Fix bugs introduced into the test suite by the release of Cirq 0.6.0.
